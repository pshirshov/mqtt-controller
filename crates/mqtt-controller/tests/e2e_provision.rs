//! End-to-end tests for the Z2mClient provisioning helpers — fetches,
//! requests, retained-message handling. Spawns an embedded `rumqttd`
//! and feeds it carefully-staged retained messages to mirror what the
//! real z2m bridge publishes.
//!
//! We don't actually run the full reconcile() against this broker; that
//! would require a fake "z2m bridge responder" simulating the
//! request/response protocol z2m exposes on `bridge/request/...` and
//! `bridge/response/...`. The bits worth covering here are the parts
//! that broke in production: retained-message fetches.
