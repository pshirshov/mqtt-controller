//! Startup state seed: prime the world state from z2m (WebSocket API)
//! and `zwave-js-server` (WebSocket API on port 3000) before the event
//! loop takes over.
//!
//! Both seeds talk directly to each bridge's own native WebSocket API
//! — no MQTT. One RTT per bridge covers every entity in one shot,
//! including sleeping or offline ones (each bridge returns its cached
//! state).
//!
//! Seed failure is non-fatal: the daemon logs and continues. The
//! wildcard `zigbee2mqtt/#` + `zwave/#` MQTT subscriptions are already
//! active at this point, so any live publishes that arrive during or
//! after startup flow into the event loop and fill in state.
