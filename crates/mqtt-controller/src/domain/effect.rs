//! Typed effects flowing OUT of the controller. Every state-machine
//! transition returns a `Vec<Effect>`; the [`crate::effect_dispatch`]
//! module translates each effect into the corresponding MQTT publish
//! via the [`crate::mqtt::MqttBridge`] handle.
//!
//! All effects reference rooms, devices, plugs, and heating zones by
//! typed index ([`RoomIdx`], [`DeviceIdx`], [`PlugIdx`], [`ZoneIdx`])
//! resolved against the topology at build time. The dispatch layer is
//! the only place that turns indexes back into MQTT topic strings.
