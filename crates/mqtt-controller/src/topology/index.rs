//! Strongly typed indexes into the topology's vec-backed collections.
//!
//! Each newtype is a positional index that's only valid against the
//! [`super::Topology`] that produced it. The runtime uses these in
//! place of `String` lookups for room / device / plug / binding /
//! heating-zone references — the index is computed once at topology
//! build time and the runtime hot path becomes array indexing.
//!
//! `PlugIdx` carries its parent [`DeviceIdx`] so a known-plug can be
//! converted back to a generic device reference for free; the reverse
//! ([`super::Topology::plug_idx`]) is fallible.
