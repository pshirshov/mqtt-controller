//! The runtime daemon: wires the [`MqttBridge`] to the [`EventProcessor`],
//! performs the startup state refresh, then runs the event loop until
//! shutdown.
//!
//! Submodules:
//!
//!   * [`startup`]    — three-phase MQTT state refresh that primes the
//!     world state before normal event processing begins.
//!   * [`event_loop`] — the long-running select loop.
//!   * [`web_bridge`] — WebSocket command + broadcast helpers used by
//!     the event loop when started with a [`WebHandle`].
//!
//! ## Startup state refresh
//!
//! Before the daemon starts processing events, it needs every zone's
//! `physically_on` to reflect physical reality. The bento-era stack
//! couldn't do this — its in-memory cache was wiped on every restart and
//! the controller had no way to ask z2m "what's on right now". The new
//! daemon does it in three phases:
//!
//!   1. **Subscribe phase.** [`MqttBridge::start`] subscribes to every
//!      group's state topic with QoS 1. mosquitto delivers retained
//!      messages immediately on subscribe — z2m publishes group state
//!      with `retain=true` on every change, so any group that has *ever*
//!      had a state change since the last retain clear will report
//!      within tens of milliseconds.
//!
//!   2. **Active query phase.** After a brief grace window collecting
//!      retained messages, the daemon publishes `{"state": ""}` to
//!      `<group>/get` for any group that did not report. z2m issues a
//!      fresh zigbee read against the group's bulbs and publishes the
//!      result on the matching state topic.
//!
//!   3. **Drain phase.** A second grace window collects the `/get`
//!      responses. Any group that *still* doesn't report state is left
//!      with `physically_on = false` (the safe assumption — the next
//!      real state message will correct it).
//!
//! Total worst-case startup latency: grace_phase_1 + grace_phase_2.
//! Currently 300 ms + 2 s = 2.3 s. The daemon does not start processing
//! button events until all three phases complete.
