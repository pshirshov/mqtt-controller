//! Periodic retention sweep.
//!
//! Two layers run on the same interval:
//!
//!   1. **Time bound** — delete every row older than
//!      `now - retention_days`. ON DELETE CASCADE on the entity index
//!      reclaims its rows automatically.
//!   2. **Per-entity row cap** — for each `entity` in
//!      `decision_log_entity` keep only the `per_entity_max_rows` most
//!      recent rows. Guards against a chatty entity pushing a quiet
//!      entity's history out of the time window.
//!
//! The sweep also runs `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum` after each pass so
//! freed pages return to the OS instead of growing the file
//! monotonically.
