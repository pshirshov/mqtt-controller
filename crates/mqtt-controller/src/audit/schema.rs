//! Schema for the audit-log database.
//!
//! Two tables. `decision_log` holds one row per processed event that
//! produced visible effects or captured decisions (the same filter the
//! WebSocket broadcast applies in `daemon::event_loop`). The auxiliary
//! `decision_log_entity` table is a many-to-many index of entity name
//! → log row, populated from `DecisionLogEntry::involved_entities`, so
//! the per-device popup query is a single index seek + ordered range.
//!
//! `STRICT` is on so column types are enforced. `id` is a synthetic
//! autoincrement key; the wire-side `seq` resets to 0 each daemon run
//! and is not stored.

/// Statements run on every open to bring an empty or pre-existing database
/// up to the current schema. Each statement is idempotent.
