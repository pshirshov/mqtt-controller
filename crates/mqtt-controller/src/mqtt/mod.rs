//! MQTT bridge: parses incoming z2m messages into [`crate::domain::Event`],
//! exposes thin pub/sub helpers (publish_group_set, publish_device_set,
//! publish_raw) that the [`crate::effect_dispatch`] module calls to
//! translate typed [`crate::domain::Effect`]s into wire-level publishes,
//! and drives the rumqttc event loop.
//!
//! Architecture:
//!
//!   * [`MqttBridge`] is the public handle. Construct via
//!     [`MqttBridge::start`], which connects to the broker, subscribes to
//!     all the topics the topology cares about, spawns a tokio task to
//!     drive the rumqttc event loop, and hands back:
//!       - the bridge handle (for publishing actions and `/get` queries)
//!       - an `mpsc::Receiver<Event>` the daemon's main loop polls
//!
//!   * The event loop runs in its own tokio task. It owns the rumqttc
//!     `EventLoop` and forwards every parseable Publish into the channel
//!     as an [`Event`]. Unrelated MQTT control packets (PingResp, etc)
//!     are silently ignored.
//!
//!   * Outbound publishes go through the `AsyncClient` clone the bridge
//!     holds. They're awaitable and bubble up [`MqttError`] on failure.
//!
//! ## Topic conventions
//!
//! z2m publishes to:
//!   - `zigbee2mqtt/<friendly_name>/action` for switch button action
//!     codes (plain text payload like `"on_press_release"`)
//!   - `zigbee2mqtt/<friendly_name>` for device state (motion sensors)
//!     and group state (z2m aggregates member states into per-group state)
//!
//! We dispatch by suffix:
//!   - `/action` → resolve via the device's switch model descriptor
//!   - bare → look up in motion sensor / group indexes
