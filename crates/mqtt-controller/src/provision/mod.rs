//! Provisioning subcommand. Reconciles z2m groups, members, scenes, and
//! per-device options against the JSON config — same five-phase shape
//! as `pkg/hue-setup/hue_setup.py`, just in Rust.
//!
//! Phases (in order):
//!
//!   1. **Names.** Walk `name_by_address` and rename any z2m device whose
//!      current `friendly_name` doesn't match the desired one. Issued
//!      with `homeassistant_rename: true` so HA's entity ids follow.
//!      Runs FIRST so all subsequent phases see the corrected names.
//!
//!   1b. **Descriptions.** Reconcile each device's z2m description against
//!       the Nix config. Uses `bridge/request/device/options` to set
//!       the `description` field. Only devices with an explicit
//!       `description` in the catalog are touched.
//!
//!   2. **Groups.** Rename groups whose id is already in z2m but whose
//!      friendly_name has drifted. Then (optionally) prune groups not in
//!      the config. Then create missing groups. Then reconcile member
//!      sets (additive by default; --prune removes extras).
//!
//!   3. **Scenes.** For each room, re-issue `scene_add` for every declared
//!      scene on every run. z2m's `bridge/groups` only reports a scene's
//!      `id` + `name`, not its brightness/color_temp/state/transition —
//!      drift in those fields would be invisible to a dedup check, so we
//!      just republish them all.
//!
//!   4. **Devices.** Per-device options writes (motion sensor sensitivity,
//!      led indication, occupancy timeout). Each option is dedup-checked
//!      against the device's retained state before writing — re-runs are
//!      no-ops once everything is in sync.
//!
//! All phases share the same [`Z2mClient`] for MQTT request/response
//! correlation via transaction ids; that piece lives in [`client`].
//!
//! Provisioning is intentionally separate from the daemon's runtime MQTT
//! loop. The two never share an MQTT connection — provisioning runs as a
//! systemd `oneShot` before the daemon starts. Conceptually they're two
//! separate programs that happen to live in one binary for deployment
//! convenience.
